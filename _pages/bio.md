Hello! Welcome to my website. I'm currently an Electrical Engineering graduate student at Princeton University in the group of [Jeff Thompson](https://sites.google.com/site/thompsonlabq/home). My research focuses on studying materials and devices that could be used to build a "quantum internet", sending quantum information across intercontinental distances. You can read more about my research [here]{{ site.baseurl }}({% link _pages/papers.md %}). I completed my undergraduate degree in physics at the University of Minnesota, where I worked on a range of topics, including dark matter detection, galactic astronomy, polymer nanopatterning, and organic semiconductors. 

I've recently taken up a hobby of making [forecasts](https://cphenicie.github.io/posts). During graduate school, I became familiar with [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/), and have since made 
[a number of changes to my life]({% link _pages/EA.md %}) to better align with these values. I'm currently exploring career options to have a higher expected impact on the long term future (perhaps through work in the realm of AI Hardware).

If you'd like to get in contact, you can email me at christopher.phenicie[at]gmail[dot]com or schedule a meeting with me [here](https://calendly.com/christopher-phenicie/30-min-meeting).
