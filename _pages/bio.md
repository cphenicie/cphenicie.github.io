Hello! I haven't made substantial updates here in a while, and probably won't in the near future. For a more up-to-date bio, please see [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-phenicie/).

Previously, I worked for [Fathom Radiant](fathomradiant.co), where I spend my days thinking about optics and my evenings thinking about AI governance and strategy. Before that, I was a graduate student at Princeton University in [Jeff Thompson's group](https://sites.google.com/site/thompsonlabq/home). My research focused on studying materials and devices that could be used to build a "quantum internet", sending quantum information over long distances. Even farther back, I completed my undergraduate degree in physics at the University of Minnesota, where I worked on a range of topics, including dark matter detection, galactic astronomy, polymer nanopatterning, and organic semiconductors. You can read more about my research [here]{{ site.baseurl }}({% link _pages/papers.md %})

If you'd like to get in contact, you can email me at christopher.phenicie[at]gmail[dot]com or schedule a meeting with me [here](https://calendly.com/christopher-phenicie/30-min-meeting).
