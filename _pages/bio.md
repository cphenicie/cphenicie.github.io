Hello! Welcome to my website. I'm currently working for [Fathom Radiant](fathomradiant.co), where I spend my days thinking about aligning optics and my evengins thinking about aligning AI with human values.

Previously, I was a graduate student at Princeton University in [Jeff Thompson's group](https://sites.google.com/site/thompsonlabq/home). My research focused on studying materials and devices that could be used to build a "quantum internet", sending quantum information over long distances. I completed my undergraduate degree in physics at the University of Minnesota, where I worked on a range of topics, including dark matter detection, galactic astronomy, polymer nanopatterning, and organic semiconductors. You can read more about my research [here]{{ site.baseurl }}({% link _pages/papers.md %})

If you'd like to get in contact, you can email me at christopher.phenicie[at]gmail[dot]com or schedule a meeting with me [here](https://calendly.com/christopher-phenicie/30-min-meeting).
