Hello! Welcome to my website. I'm currently an Electrical Engineering graduate student at Princeton University in the group of <cite><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/thompsonlabq/home">Jeff Thompson</a></cite>. My research focuses on studying materials and devices that could be used to build a "quantum internet", sending quantum information across intercontinential distances. I'm hoping to continue to have a positive impact on the world via advanced technology (perhaps in the realm of AI hardware).
